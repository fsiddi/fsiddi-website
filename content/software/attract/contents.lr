description: Attract was developed during the production of Tears of Steel and since then has been slowly improving to serve as a decent GTD application for CG/VFX movie makers. With Attract you can keep track of the shots of your production, group them in scenes, assign them to users and generate some useful stats about how many seconds of the film are complete or in progress.
