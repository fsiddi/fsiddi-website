      <p class="lead">First person bio</p>
      <p>I discovered content production as a teenager, in the early 2000s.
        The thrill of creating music, interactive visuals and bring people together by doing so, stays with me to this day.
        Around that time, I also learned about free and open source software, with Blender standing at the crossroad between these two worlds.</p>
      <p>I went on to study Industrial Design, and started a small business producing multimedia and industrial 3D visualizations.</p>
      <p>In 2012, I joined the Blender project as 3D artist on the Tears of Steel open movie, and have been involved in many aspects of it ever since.</p>
      <p>In 2021 my role at Blender has been formalized as general manager of Blender Studio and COO for Blender.</p>
      <p>Since 2024, I joined the Blender Foundation board as secretary.</p>
